How to use:
1. Insert giphy key and discordpy key in code
2. Add bot to discord server and do !pb in any channel
3. Bot will start spamming random gis that are captioned with [**REDACTED**]
4. !pb again to make it stop
5. don't enjoy! (forget that I said enjoy earlier, one thing you should know about me - never take my words too seriously, it's for your own good)
6. save your dignity and honor by not using this bot
